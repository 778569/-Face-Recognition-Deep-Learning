# Face-Recognition-Deep-Learning
Face recognition is used for to unlocking cell phones. And with recent advancements in deep learning,In this repository how to develop a face recognition system that can detect faces in images, identify the faces, and even modify faces with "digital makeup" like you've experienced in popular mobile apps

# Part 01 - Face Recognition Pipeline Steps


Step 1: Locate and extract faces from each image
Step 2: Identify facial features in each image
Step 3: Align faces to match pose template
Step 4: Encode faces using a trained neural network
Step 5: Check Euclidean distance between face encodings

Use of face recognition 
1.	Identify verificationâ€™
2.	Automatically organizing new photo libraries by person.
3.	Tracking a specific person
4.	Counting unique people
5.	Finding people with similar appearances.
